## Aspire Part Two - Deploying

I remember many moons ago sitting at a presentation by a local Microsoft representative.  He was telling us all about how SSIS would be replacing DTS for data integrations, and plus it was "free" with SQL Server.  They did a very nice dog and pony show, and at first it was amazing to see how easy it was to, as one of my coworkers called it, "programming with pictures".  However, this was soon followed by the harsh reality of actually using SSIS in real life.  At first it was fast, then it got all sorts of buggy (this was an early release), then it got slow.... really slow.  Since those days, all those problems have been fixed, but my point is the awesome new tool can sometimes cause as many problems as it solves.  Like that medicine for tardive dyskinesia that has a side effect of involuntary muscle movements.
Therefore, I have always been wary and I feel that Technology is like fashon, never be the first to adopt, and never be the last to abandon. All of this rambling, because I really like what Aspire does, but I fear there is a looming iceberg waiting to sink my ship.  It worked great on my machine, but what happens when you try to deploy it?
