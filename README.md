## Software developer, Tinkerer, Meddler, and Bit Twiddler Extraordinaire

As an accomplished IT professional with extensive experience in software development across a wide range of technologies, I have honed my skills in C#, .NET, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, SQL Server, Oracle, React, and Angular. My career spans applications development, data application services, business intelligence, system administration, conversions, business requirements analysis, implementations, and report management.
I also have the following qualities:
- Spell Awful 
    - Is that how you spell awful?
- Sesquipedalian 
    - If you use this word you are one.
- Highly Opinionated 
    - Which doesn't matter because I am always right! 
- Sarcastic 
    - No Way, not me!
- Take the path less travelled 
    - I hear that only 2.5% of the workforce are code monkeys.

## Technology
Like every techie out there, I love technology.  What's not to love? It can make our lives simpler.  It can help us to do more. It can make connections and access simpler.  There is a certain comfort in the consistancy technology provides. There is a constant change in technology. It can be hard to keep up. It can take so much of your time. It can expose your personal data to the world. It can lead to addiction and environmental issues. It can be the bane of your existence when it doesn't work properly. I hate technology.
> Like everyone, I have a love/hate relationship with Tech.
> The struggle to keep up is real.
