Of course it has to work. Microsoft would never put out something half baked, would they?
The scientific method has to prevail.  So step back, take a breath, and start from the begining.
This time keep it simple, use all Microsoft Samples all the way, and make no alterations to anything.  If it works with the basics, then maybe I messed something up last time. If it still doesn't work, I guess it is one of those undocumented features or hoops you have to jump through.

### Start From the Begining With the Beginning 
- Created a new repo in github for the simple app
- Cloned the new empty repo to my local machine
- Created the Aspire Demo App
- Commited and pushed to repo
