# Holy Traitorous Aspirations Batman!

### When we last saw our heros they were faced with an overwhelming enemy.  Their former ally had turned against them, leaving the dynamic duo in mortal danger!

### Would it mean an end to the Aspire journey?  But, just as it seemed all hope was lost...

### But would science prevail over such a challenge?

Of course it has to work. Microsoft would never put out something half baked, would they?
The scientific method has to prevail.  So step back, take a breath, and start from the begining.
This time keep it simple, use all Microsoft Samples all the way, and make no alterations to anything.  If it works with the basics, then maybe I messed something up last time. If it still doesn't work, I guess it is one of those undocumented features or hoops you have to jump through.
So I cleaned up my last attempt so everything would be fresh:
- Delete the old Azure Resource Group
- Delete the old Github Repo


### Start From the Begining With the Beginning 
- Created a new repo in github for the simple app
- Cloned the new empty repo to my local machine
- Created the Aspire Demo App

- Commited and pushed to repo
  - This time I added the folders to the gitignore so all the .vs, bin and obj doesn't go up

- open command prompt in folder
- Login to Azure
  ```sh
  azd auth login
  ```
- Initialize the app
  ```sh
  azd init
  ```
- Select ***Use code in current directory*** when prompted
- Select ***Confirm and continue initializing my app***
- Provided an environment name *aspire-app-simple*

- Enter the command to push to Azure
```sh
azd up
```
- Selected subscription
- Selected a regional location *East US*
  - waited for provisioning to happen...

Let's try those URLs

And There we go it is working properly.  Of course, it was working properly here for me before at this point.
Now comes the time for the CI/CD pipeline this is when it stopped working properly last time.

- Enter the command to create the pipeline.
  
~~~sh
azd pipeline config
~~~

- Select a provider Github
- Create a azure-dev.yml file Yes
- Commit and push Yes
(Since I was already logged in and repo was created above these steps were simplified)

Pipeline is complete

And it still works! But let's make some changes and see what happens.  I did a basic text change to the home page, commited and pushed.
Pipeline runs:

And it stil works

**Success**

What was wrong last time?
Really not sure, but here are the differences
- gitignore file modifications
- Repo first instead of auto create
- Basic aspire application

I have a feeling my original project and repo got messed up, maybe it was the gitignore, or maybe it was all the editing I had done befre the pipline and repo was created.
