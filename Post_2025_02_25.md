# Aspire Part 3 Using CI/CD #


I am going to pick up from where I left off last week in [Post 2025-02-18 .Net Aspire to the world](Post_2025_02_18.md) I have a .Net Aspire app and it is deployed to Azure.  Now I want all my updates to go through automagically in a continuous integration / continuous deployment fashion.  What would all of this require?

**Repo First**

You don't have to create a repo first, the process can create one for you automagically.  I just wanted the repo first.  
So, I went to github, signed in, and under the reositories tab, clicked new. The important thing is to get the Repo URL you will need it later.

**Azure Devloper Command**

That's right! A command not lot's of commands.  Just enter the one command in powershell from the solution directory.
~~~sh
azd pipeline config
~~~
This starts a wizard to set up your application's pipeline, and here are the steps:

- Select a provider (AZDO/Github)
- Create a azure-dev.yml file (Yes/No)
- Log in to Github with CLI (Yes/No)
- Select a preferred protocol (HTTPS/FTP)
- Authenticate to Github with Credentials (Yes/No)
- How would you like to authenticate? (Login with web Browser)

- You are now given a code to connect to github, and are sent to the browser to complete the action.  Once complete you get the following confirmation in powershell:

- Next it checks the solution to see if it is part of a git repo, mine was not yet so it promted me to add (Yes/No)
- Select how to configure your git remote to github (Create/Enter URL)
  - Earlier I had created the repo, so I chose Enter a remote URL
- Enter the remote url

> Gotcha:  Here I got an error, because I needed to log in again.  This kicked me out of the wizard.  I had to reconnect.
> ~~~sh
> azd auth login --scope https://graph.microsoft.com/.default
> ~~~

> Interestingly, I thought I would have to go all through the steps again, but simply entering the command:
> ~~~sh
> azd pipeline config
> ~~~
> 
> continued the process

- The final prompt is about pushing your local changes (Yes/No)  *Uhh, yeah, isn't that the point of all this?*
  - I am sure if you choose no you can push them manually.

And that was it for the set up.  Now does all of this actually work? 
Notice that a github action was created and a link is provided.  Drilling into the action shows the steps and completion success:

So far so good.  But is it really working.  Browsing back to the site gives a big surprise:

Oh that doesn't look good.  What changed? 2 things. 1 The CI/CD and I added a Code first Postgres database instance.  The API initializes it so lets see if that is the issue. This will also test the CI\CD process. 
- Removed the references in the API and commit my changes.
- The Github action shows running

Once complete let's return to the site, and no change!  The Postgres is removed from the Aspire dashboard, so it is nothing to do with that at all.
- Added Postgres back, commited, redeployed, Postgres is back in the Aspire dashboard.
- Checked the API and it is working fine, returns the results from the endpoint.
- Actually the page is working, the weather forecast page shows the weather forecast as supplied by the api

After redeploying with a new pipeline and app container it was still the same! 
Is all lost? Is it curtains for the caped crusader and his avian sidekick?  What will our heroes do?  Tune in next week kids, same Bat time, same Bat channel!
